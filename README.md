**If you intend to make use of student benefits
**

Azure has been a bit finicky relating to student login for me. After multiple attempts of logging in to my student account/converting my normal account to a student account I eventually landed upon this particular site and went through the apply link at the top of the page. 

I am currently unsure if this was this particular link that finally managed to confirm my student status, or if the Azure platform takes its time to confirm my status.

Regardless, I have now access to my free student benefits and can confirm for fellow ENTA students that the student offer as of the moment of writing this section (05/07/2023) is still functional.

Student benefit limitations

There are a few services you will not be able to access on a student subscription. But more problematic, there is a limit on how many public IPs and CPUs you can make use of at any time. As such you will not only be limited by your credits, but by what the platform enables you to do or create.

If this is your first time using this sort of platform

Free credits in a 12 month period does not mean complete free unlimited use of Azure resources for 12 months. 

More powerful machines will imply a larger price per hour which will be deducted from your credits. 

And unless configured to work otherwise, your machines will keep running even if you log off from your account, making it a necessity to turn off/delete any machines or any other service that you will not need running after you stop working with Azure for the day. 

Not doing this will be a quick way to spend all of your credits in a somewhat short span of time, and if you do run out of credits you will be locked out of using the platform and anything you might have in it until you pay for normal access or get another student subscription.

You can check your credits by going to the search box in the main page and writing/selecting ‘Education’. Education overview will show the expiration date and current amount of the credits you have available.
